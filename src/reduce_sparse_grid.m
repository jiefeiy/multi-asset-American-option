function Sr=reduce_sparse_grid(S,tol)

% REDUCE_SPARSE_GRID given a sparse grid stored as a list of tensor grids (see also SMOLYAK_GRID)
% generates a reduced structure containing only non repeated points and corresponding weights.
%
% SR = REDUCE_SPARSE_GRID(S) operate on the sparse grid S and returns SR, i.e.
%       a so-called reduced sparse grid, that is a structure with fields
%       -> Sr.knots:  list of non repeated knots
%       -> Sr.weights: list of corresponding weights
%       -> Sr.size: the number of non repeated knots
%       -> Sr.n: says where each element of [S.knots] will be mapped to in Sr.knots, i.e. for any k [S.knots](:,Sr.m(k))==Sr.knots(:,k)
%       -> Sr.m: for each element of Sr.knots, says where it's coming from in [S.knots], i.e. "the element in position k of [S.knots] goes in position n(k) in Sr.knots"
%        or [S.knots](:,j)==Sr.knots(:,Sr.n(j)) and in general [S.knots](:,Sr.n==i)==Sr.knot(:,i)
%
% SR = REDUCE_SPARSE_GRID(S,TOL) uses a tolerance TOL to identify coincident points 
%       (default value 1e-14)

% first of all, a safety check: are we using a sufficiently fine tol when detecting identical points?
detect_insufficient_tolerance(kk,Tol);


% first, I order the rows of kk in lexicographic order. If I use mysortrows then two rows like
%
% [a b c d]
% [a-t b c+t d]
% 
% are considered equal (if t < Tol ) and therefore placed one after the other

%[kk_ordered,i]=sortrows(kk);

% i is an index vector that maps kk into kk_ordered, i.e. kk(i,:)==kk_ordered

%[kk_ordered,i]=mysortrows(kk,Tol/size(kk,2)); % this will not work properly if more than 10 rv are used, the
%toll will be too small!
[kk_ordered,i]=mysortrows(kk,Tol);

% next I take the difference of two consecutive rows. if the difference is small, then the rows are the same, i.e. the knot is the same
dkk_ordered=diff(kk_ordered,1,1);

% I measure the difference with infty norm instead of L2 norm:
% i take  the maximum component of each row (2 means "operate on columns"):
%       max(abs(dkk_ordered),[],2)    
% then I want to see which ones have this max bigger than Tol
%       j*=max(abs(dkk_ordered),[],2)>Tol
% this command returns a vector of True and false
%       j*=[1 1 0 1 1]
% this means that 2nd multiindex is different from 1st, 3rd from 2nd, but 4th is equal to 3rd ( diff(3)=v(4)-v(3) ). So I shouldn't take it.

% How do I use this j* to build a vector j with the rows that I have to select from kk? 
% I could use only the rows of j* that are True
%       j=find((j*==True))
%       kk_reduced=kk_order(j,:), 
% NB
%       I can shortcut find((j*==True)) with  find(j*)
% so that I take rows 1,2, 4 but not 3.
% If I do like this, I forget the last row!! (diff has 1 row less than kk). So I add a non zero difference at the end, and come to

j=find([max(abs(dkk_ordered),[],2)>Tol;2*Tol]);  

%j=find([sqrt(sum(dkk_ordered.^2,2))>Tol;2*Tol]); %L2 norm

% now I can create the reduced knots
kk_reduced=kk_ordered(j,:);

% in the same way, I pick up only the j entries of the indeces vector i. 
index_reduced=i(j)';
% in this way I have a mapping from the original set kk to the reduced set kk_reduced:
% i.e. kk(index_reduced,:)==kk_reduced.
% this means that:
%   -> lenght(index_reduced) < size(kk,1)
%   -> index_reduced is not sorted

% I also need the inverse mapping, i.e. how to reconstruct the original kk given kk_reduced. This is needed for the computation of weights
% associated to each knot

%%% naif solution

% invindex has to be of the same length than kk and kk_ordered. 
% NB: length(i)==size(kk,1) as it is the mapping from kk to kk_ordered

invindex=zeros(length(i),1); 

k=1;  % k scrolls the vector invindex

% I build invindex working on kk_ordered: if for example
%
% j=[1 2 4 5 7]
%
% then it means that knot 1 will be picked up, and placed in position 1  in kk_reduced. Same for knot 2.
% Conversely knot 3 won't be picked up, and 4 will be placed instead in position 3 ! Then it means that knot 3 and 4 will have a single
% instance in kk_reduced, and the position on this image in kk_reduced is written in invindex. i.e. so far
%
% invindex=[1 2 3 3 4 5 5].
% I read this as "element in position k in kk_ordered becomes element invindex(k) in kk_reduced"

for l=1:length(j)
    invindex(k:j(l)) = l;
    k=j(l)+1;
end

% then I go back to the original kk. I go from kk to kk_ordered with the map i: kk(i,:)==kk_ordered. 
% So far invindex goes from kk_ordered to kk_reduced, and I would like to permute invindex with i^-1, to go back 
% to the order of kk:
%
% invindex_kk=invindex(i^-1). (@)
%
% I can do like this: say that 
%
% i=[3 1 2], invindex=[1 1 2]
%
% then kk(3,:) is the 1st row of kk_ordered, and goes in the 1st row of kk_reduced. Then from position 1 of i and invindex I get
%
% invindex_kk(3)=invindex(1)
% 
% and similar, 1st row of kk -> 2nd row of kk_ordered -> 1st row of kk_reduced, then
%
% invindex_kk(1)=invindex(2)
%
% therefore in general
%
% invindex_kk(i)=invindex (that is, inverting @)<--------------- in short, invindex_kk permuted as i gives invindex
%
% Then, instead of building two vectors, invindex and invindex_kk, i overwrite the former with the latter

invindex(i)=invindex;


% The usage of invindex is:
%
% "element in position k of kk goes in position invindex(k) in kk_reduced"


%%%


Sr.knots=kk_reduced';
Sr.m=index_reduced;

nb_knots_reduced=length(index_reduced);

Sr.weights=zeros(1,nb_knots_reduced);

% finally, i use invindex to compute weights

Sr.n=invindex;
for i=1:length(invindex)
    idx_reduced=invindex(i);
    Sr.weights(idx_reduced) = Sr.weights(idx_reduced)+ww(i);
