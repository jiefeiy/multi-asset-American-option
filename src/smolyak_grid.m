function [S,C] = smolyak_grid(N,w,knots,lev2knots,idxset,S2,arg7) %#ok<INUSD>


%  SMOLYAK_GRID generates a Smolyak sparse grid (and corresponding quadrature weights)
%  as a linear combination of full tensor grids, employing formula (2.9)
%  of [Nobile-Tempone-Webster, SINUM 46/5, pages 2309-2345] 
%
%  [S,C] = SMOLYAK_GRID(N,W,KNOTS,LEV2KNOTS,IDXSET) creates a sparse grid in N dimensions
%       using the multiindex set defined by
%
%       IDXSET(I) <= W,   
%
%       where  I is N-dimensional multiindex, W is an integer non-negative value and IDXSET is a function.
%       IDXSET is an optional argument, the default being IDXSET = @(i) sum(i-1).
%
%       KNOTS is either a cell array containing the functions to be used to generate the knots 
%       in each direction, i.e. 
%   
%       KNOTS={@knots_function1, @knots_function2, ... }
%
%       or a single function to be used in every direction, i.e.  KNOTS=@knots_function1.
%       In both cases, the header of knots_function is [x,w]=knots_function(m)
%
%       LEV2KNOTS is either a cell array containing the functions defining the relation between level 
%       and number of knots to be used in each direction, i.e. 
%
%       LEV2KNOTS={@m_function1, @m_function2, ... }
%
%       or a single function to be used in every direction, i.e. LEV2KNOTS=@m_function1
%       In both cases, the header of m_function is m=m_function(i)
%
%       The sparse grid information is stored as a vector of "tensor grids", 
%       each "tensor grid" S(j) is a seven fields structure:
%           S(j).knots: vector containing the tensor grid knots
%           S(j).weights: vector containing the corresponding weights
%           S(j).size: size of the tensor grid, S(j).size = prod(m)
%           S(j).knots_per_dim: cell array (N components), each component is the set of 1D knots used 
%               to build the tensor grid    
%           S(j).m: the input vector m, m == lev2knots(idx), m(i)==length(S(j).knots_per_dim(i))
%           S(j).coeff: how many times the tensor grid appears in the sparse grid (with sign)
%               the index j runs over all points in the level set Y(W,N) 
%           S(j).idx: the multiidx vector corresponding to the current grid, whose number of points
%               is defined by lev2knots(i)
%
%       The outputs of SMOLYAK_GRID are 
%       S: structure containing the information on the sparse grid (vector of tensor grids; see above)
%       C: multi-index set used to generate the sparse grid. It is sorted lexicographically and contains all
%           multi-indices, even those whose coefficient in the combination technique is 0. 
%           The reduced multi-idx set D with only the indices with non-zero coefficient can be obtained as 
%           
%           nb_idx = length(S);
%           D = reshape([S.idx],N,nb_idx)'; 
% 
%           and will be lexicographic sorted as well
%
%
%
% [S,C] = SMOLYAK_GRID(N,W,KNOTS,LEV2KNOTS,IDXSET,S2), where S2 is another Smolyak grid, 
%       tries to recycle tensor grids from S2 to build those of S instead of recomputing them.
%       This can be helpful whenever sequences of Smolyak grid are generates. Note that *NO* check
%       will performed whether S2 was generated with the same lev2knots as the one given as input.
%       S2 can also be empty, S2=[]. To use the default IDXSET, use IDXSET=[];

    % now compute the tensor grids out of the delta operators listed in C.
    % Exploit partial ordering of the sequence of multiindices
    %-----------------------------------------------
    %
    % each multiindex of C is a delta grid. Given say [i1 i2 i3] i will get
    % (i1 - i1-1) x (i2 - i2-1) x (i3 - i3-1)
    % that is the grids associated to
    % [i1 i2 i3],[i1-1 i2 13],[i1 i2-1 i3],[i1-1 i2-1 i3] and so on
    %
    % note that all of these multiindeces are also included in the initial set C
    % (if [i1 i2 i3] ratisfies the rule, all other will, because their indeces are equal or lower)
    %
    % So the set of all possible grids (non delta grids) is the same set C, but some of them will cancel out
    %
    % C is partially ordered (lexicographis): [x x x x i], are listed increasing with i,
    % [x x x j i] are listed increasing first with j and then with i ...
    % Now take a row of C, c. Because of the ordering, if you take c as a grid index
    % the same grid can appear again only from delta grids coming from rows following.
    %
    % Now we scroll these rows following (say c2) and compute how many times c will be generated, and with
    % what sign. It has to be that d=c2-c has only 0 or 1
    %
    % if this is the case, the sign of this new appearence of c could be both + or - .
    % To determine the sign, start with + and switch it every time a 1 appears in d
    %
    % d=[0 1 0 0 1] => sign= +
    %
    % the formula is (-1)^sum(d) ( d with even appearences of 1 gives a + , odd gives a -)

    [~,bookmarks]=unique(C(:,1),'first');

    for i=1:nn % scroll c
        cc = C(i,:);
        % recover the range in which we have to look. Observe that the first column of C contains necessarily 1,2,3 ...
